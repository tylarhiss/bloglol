## Goal

This blog is the start of something big. Together we're going to answer the big questions in life such as "Is this beer good?" or even "is there somewhere in town with a bad rueben?". I can't promise we'll have the answers immediately, but I can promise that we will try.


## Let's Talk Shades Brewery
Some people are all about Shades and their beers. I've pondered to myself.. why is that? Are they secretly getting paid to promote the brand with odd flavors and it is all a big conspiracy? I've taken it upon myself to try as many flavors as possible to determine if anything can be considered **good**. Below is a quick table with some initial results. 


| Flavor    | Result    | Additional Comments |
| ------    | -------   | -----                 |      
| PBJ Rasperry Sour      |  ⛔ | It did taste like a PB&J a little but now I was was asking myself... why am I drinking a PB&J|
| Hoochy Kuchen Sour  |  ✅  | Actually kinda good.  |
| Sounds Gay I'm In | ⚠️   |  Little strong, def not bad tho. |
| Painapple Cocokiller Sour  | ⛔   | I love pineapple and this had a distinct lack of that.   |
| Orange Papaya  | ⛔  | Where is the orange!?   |
| Pecan Maple Latte  | ⚠️  |    |
| Carrot Cake | ✅  | Probably requires love for Carrot Cake   |
| Eggnog  | ⛔  | This was a mistake.   |
| Orange Creamsicle   |  ✅ |    |
| Peach Cobbler Sour  | ✅   |    |

### More flavors to come
This is just the beginning. Going forward I'll do full writeups of each flavor

## What is a Rueben?
Take a look at this picture and tell me that this isn't the most delicious looking sandwhich you've ever seen.

We're going around town trying differen't Ruebens to see where they stack!
